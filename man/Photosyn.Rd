\description{
A coupled photosynthesis - stomatal conductance model, based on the Farquhar model of photosynthesis, and a Ball-Berry type model of stomatatal conductance. Includes options for temperature sensitivity of photosynthetic parameters, dark respiration (optionally calculated from leaf temperature), and mesophyll conductance.
}
\details{
The coupled photosynthesis - stomatal conductance model finds the intersection between the supply of CO2 by diffusion, and the demand for CO2 by photosynthesis. See Farquhar and Sharkey (1982) for basic description of this type of model. 

The model of Farquhar et al. (1980) is used to estimate the dependence of photosynthesis rate on Ci.
 
 The temperature response of photosynthetic parameters, including Vcmax, Jmax, Gammastar, and Km follow Medlyn et al. 2002. 
 
 At the moment, two stomatal conductance models are implemented, both are Ball-Berry type models. The 'BBOpti' model is a slightly more general form of the model of Medlyn et al. 2011 (see Duursma et al. 2013). It is given by (in notation of the parameters and output variables of \code{Photosyn}),
 
 \deqn{GS = G0 + 1.6*(1 + G1/D^(1-GK))*ALEAF/CA}
 
 where GK = 0.5 if stomata behave optimally (cf. Medlyn et al. 2011).
 
 The 'BBLeuning' model is that of Leuning (1995). It is given by,
 
 \deqn{GS = G0 + g1*ALEAF/(Ca * (1 + VPD/D0))}
 
 Note that this model also uses the g1 parameter, but it needs to be set to a much higher value to be comparable in magnitude to the BBOpti model.
 
 The 'BallBerry' model is that of Ball et al. (1987). It is given by,
 
 \deqn{GS = G0 + g1*RH*ALEAF/Ca}
 
 Where RH is relative humidity.
 
 For the full numerical solution to the Cowan-Farquhar optimization, use the \code{\link{FARAO}} function.
 
 If the mesophyll conductance is provided, it is assumed that Vcmax and Jmax are the chloroplastic rates, and leaf photosynthesis is calculated following Ethier and Livingston (2004).
 
 If Ci is provided as an input, this function calculates an A-Ci curve. Otherwise, Ci is calculated from the intersection between the 'supply' and 'demand', where 'demand' is given by the Farquhar model of photosynthesis (A=f(Ci)), and supply by the stomatal conductance. The latter is, by default, estimated using the stomatal conductance model of Medlyn et al. (2011), but two other models are provided as well (Ball-Berry and Leuning, see \code{gsmodel} argument). Otherwise, stomatal conductance may be directly provided via the \code{GS} argument. 
 
Note that the function \code{Aci} is provided as a shorthand for \code{Photosyn(Ci=x)}.
 
 By default, the \code{Photosyn} function returns the hyperbolic minimum of Vcmax and Jmax-limited photosynthetic rates. This is to avoid the discontinuity at the transition between the two rates. Both Ac and Aj are also returned should they be needed. Note that those rates are output as gross photosynthetic rates (leaf respiration has to be subtracted to give net leaf photosynthesis).
}
\section{Atmospheric pressure}{


A correction for atmospheric pressure (Patm) is implemented in \code{\link{fitaci}}, but \strong{not in Photosyn}. In \code{fitaci}, the necessary corrections are applied so that estimated Vcmax and Jmax are expressed at standard pressure (Patm=100kPa). In Photosyn, however, the corrections are much more complicated and tend to be very small, because effects of Patm on partial pressures are largely offset by increases in diffusivity (Terashima et al. 1995, Gale 1973). 

Note that Patm is an argument to the Photosyn function, but it only affects calculations of Km and GammaStar (as used by fitaci), and transpiration rate. Setting only Patm \strong{does not correct for atmospheric pressure effects on photosynthesis rates}.
